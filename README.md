# Algorithms-Data-Structures-Assignment
This program when ran will prompt the user for the name of a text file which contains a graph and also prompt for a starting vertex. It will then read the graph from the text file and will represent it as a adjacency list data structure. The program will then run each traversal method, Depth first traversal, Breadth first traversal, Prim's minimum spanning tree and Dijkstra's shortest path tree, and output its workings as it is doing it. Depth first traversal and Breadth first traversal are cormen's version. Depth first traversal uses recursion and Breadth first traversal uses a circular queue. Prim's and Dijkstra's algorithm both use a heap. In the assignment pdf you can find my report which contains a step by step construction of Prim's and Dijkstra's algorithm, diagrams of adminimum spanning tree, Shortest path tree, Depth first search and Breadth first search and finally screen captures of the program executing on a sample graph.
